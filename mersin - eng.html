           <li> Kanlidivane Antik Kenti  <img class="mekanresim" src="mersin/mersin-kanlidivane-antik-kenti.jpg" alt=""></a></li>
           <p> 
            Kanytella, today known as Kanlıdivane, is located in the inner part of the mountain side 3 kilometers after Eliaussa Sebaste (Ayaş). The settlement, which covers the edge of a sinkhole (about 170 X 200 meters in size), which is 60 meters deep and descended by steps carved into the rocks, was connected to the Olba Dynasty in the 2nd century BC, as the inscriptions document, and even served as the port of Olba to the sea.

            Based on the geographic similarity with the Korykon Antron (Heaven-Hell), there is a Hellenistic sanctuary inside the pothole. The tower, built of polygonal blocks on the south edge of the pothole, was built by Priest Prince Tuekros, son of Tarkyaris at the beginning of the 2nd century BC and was dedicated to Zeus Olbios.
            
            There are reliefs of the Armaronxas family on the south wall inside the pothole. The relief, located in a 4x2 meter niche, has a somewhat rough workmanship. There is a five-line inscription on the right side of the relief and the names of the family are included here. The family consists of six people, the father and mother live next to their four children. One of them is boy and three of them are girls.

           <p> 
            Kızkalesi, located 24 kilometers east of Silifke and 60 km west of Mersin, was named after the castle on the sea with the legend told by the inhabitants of the region 85 years ago.
           
            This magnificent beauty also has a deeply affecting story.
             
            One of the kings living in Korykos prayed day and night for a baby girl. Finally, her wish was fulfilled and she had a very beautiful daughter. The king's daughter got more beautiful as she grew older. She won the admiration and love of everyone, as well as her gods, with her benevolence as well as beauty.
             
            One day, a scientist comes to the city of Korykos. The king also invites him to the palace. The king wants to know about his daughter's future. When he looks at the knowing girl, he is startled and afraid, but he does not say anything to the king. When the king forced the conscious, “My king, a snake will sting your beautiful daughter and your daughter will die. Nobody will be able to spoil this fate. You will experience the pain. "You will not be able to prevent it either."
             
            The king does not tell his daughter about this, but he is deep in thought with sadness. Finally, he built a castle on a small islet near the shore opposite Korykos Castle.
             
            He closes his beautiful daughter in this castle with his servants. The girl, unaware of what is happening, is very upset, melts away day by day, and cannot make sense of what is happening. One day the girl's soul asks for the golden yellow "Tarsus White" grape. A snake coming out of the grape basket sent from the palace bites and kills him.
