                            Although the Storm Creek is the most ideal place for stream sports (canoe-Rafting) enthusiasts in Rize, Taşlıdere and Ikizdere (Iyidere) stand out as other alternatives. Storm Creek was formed by the merger of Cascade streams from the slopes of the Kaçkar Mountains facing the Black Sea, so it is considered the most important in terms of stream tourism in the streams in Rize. The Storm Creek, which flows into the Black Sea about 2 km west of ardeşen, is 57 km long. The storm, which flows through the tea and fruit gardens and under the historic stone arch bridges that are still in use, provides opportunities not only for excitement and sport, but also for travel through the heart of Rize culture. From the Rize - Ardeşen highway, you can follow the highway to the south and reach Çamlıhemşin after 22 km. About 1 km south of Çamlıhemşin, the trail can be started. Along the course, which lasts about 23 km, the bed of the stream is multi-Stony, there are places with a degree of difficulty of 3-4-5 depending on the flow of water. Attention should be paid especially after extreme rains.

                        <p>Ikizdere Valley, one of the 200 most important valleys in the world, is frequented by amateur rafters as well as professionals. Ikizdere River, which has a total of 25 kilometers of trails, has 3 different trails according to the degree of difficulty and is completed in an average of 1.5 hours. May and June are the times when athletes come the most. The surrounding highlands such as the Anzer plateau, Cimil, Ovit and Kabahor also offer the opportunity to rest or camp when you take a break, and are breathtaking in their beauty. </p>

                            Ayder Plateau, one of the most tourist highlands of Rize... Ayder, a plateau covered with spruce and beech forests in the District of Chamlykhemshin, admires those who see it at an altitude of 1350 meters.

                             Even watching storm Creek and listening to its voice can be enough to give you great moments. The feature that distinguishes Storm Creek from other streams is the arch bridges on it... you can take the opportunity to watch the creek by going to one of these bridges. In addition, if you went during the season, you may have a chance to rafting with professionals in the creek.
